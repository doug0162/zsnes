There are no useful changes made in this REPO. It is mearly a university exercise in the basics of git which I'm too nostalgic to delete. Have a nice day.

If you are using the CVS version of ZSNES, you will need to run the following
command directly after checkout out the repository:

sh autogen.sh

This will create the ./configure file that you need to run before compiling
ZSNES.

If you are not sure if you are using the CVS version, you are probably not.
